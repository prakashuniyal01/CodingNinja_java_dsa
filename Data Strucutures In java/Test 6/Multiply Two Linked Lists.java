// Multiply Two Linked Lists
// Send Feedback
// 1. You are given two linked lists. Data of each node of these linked lists contain a digit from the range: [0, 9].
// 2. The linked lists represent two numbers.
// 3. You have to print the product of these two numbers.
// Input Format:
// Input has already been managed for cpp and java submissions. In cpp and java, you have to just write a function which receives head nodes of two linked lists. The sizes of linked lists are N and M, respectively.
// For other languages, the first line of input contains list of N space separated integers, terminated by -1. The following line of input also contains list of M space separated integers, terminated by -1. The integers form the data of nodes of two linked list.   
// Constraints:
// N and M lies in the range: [1, 1000].
// 0 <= |Node Data| <= 9
// Output format:
// Print the product of numbers, represented by two linked lists.
// Sample Input:
// 1 2 3 4 5 -1
// 1 2 3 -1
// Sample Output:
// 1 5 1 8 4 3 5
